## Welcome

We're setting up a few very simple Python examples using various Spark libraries! Feel free to clone the repo and look through the code to familiarize yourself with how to use Spark in tandem with Python.

## About this repo

We want to learn about [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and we are using this repo to do so. Our first project uses the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) to get tweets and analyze them in various ways. More to come if we ever finish this project or add on to it!

## Getting started

First, you may as well clone the repo. Now that you've done that, you should get some Twitter API credentials! If you have a Twitter account already, just go to [this link](https://apps.twitter.com/) and create a new app. We use [Tweepy]() as our Twitter client in order to access the API, you can install it through the aforementioned link, or by running `pip install tweepy==3.3.0`. While there are newer versions than 3.3.0, there are supposedly some bugs that make it more convenient to use an older version. if `pip` isn't installed on your computer you should get a message telling you how to install it (hint: run `sudo apt install pip` on a Linux machine). Good luck!
