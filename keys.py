"""
This file MUST be added to .gitignore. Do not ever check it in to the repo as the following keys will be unique to each user and must be kept 'secret'. If you are unsure whether this file is being ignored by git, do the following.
    1) Make sure you are in the directory where this file is stored on your machine (it's probably something like ~/gitRepos/spark or ~/documents/repos/spark).
    2) Type the following into a terminal window:
        git update-index --assume-unchanged keys.py
For more information on what the command above does, view this link:
    https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#ignoring-versioned-files

The methods below will initially do nothing when you clone this repo (except cause an error when you try to use them to get relevant keys for the twitter api). Replace the return statements below so that you retrieve your personal key, token, and secrets for the Twitter API.
